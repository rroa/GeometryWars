#Geometry Wars Clone

This is a Geometry Wars clone by Raul Roa.

If you want to build this code on linux you first need to install the following libraries:
* OpenGL
* GLU
* SDL
* SDL Mixer (for playing audio)

If you are using Ubuntu you can install these libraries by typing the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev  libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

```

Then , finally , build the code by running the following command
```
make linux
```
